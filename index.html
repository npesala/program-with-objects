        <b>Web Overview</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> 
The basics of web include HTML, URLS, HTTP, web apps, and the web itself. 
The browser makes requests via the internet to servers. These requests are using <em>http</em> and <em>servers</em> respond with files that your browser displays <b>Ex: firefox, chrome</b> Servers are computers similar to are but they host files and are not placed on desks. Http is the main protocol that the browser uses to communicate with the servers.

        <b>HTML</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> Hyper Text Markup Language It is the basis of almost every webpage and glues everything together. It is made up of <em>text context "what you see" and markup "what it looks like”</em>. The majority of documents on the web are HTML documents.</p>

        <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> HTML documents are made up of element created by tags.  In HTML we tell the browser the type of each element through tags.  <b>Ex of tags: b-tag: bold, em-tag: emphasis (italics), img-tag: images, br-tag: break (forces HTML to produce multiple lines),p-tag: paragraph (creates invisible box around text) </b> </p>

<div class="section-name">
  <b>HTML, CSS and Developer Tools</b>
</div>
  <div class="section-details">
  <p>
HTML controls the structure of the page, while CSS controls style of the page. HTML and CSS are both <em>“languages”</em>. There is also something else called JavaScript which controls the interactive components. To see the structure of a page first you go to file and click tools and then click developer tools to see the structure </p>

<div class="section-name">
  <b>Tree-like Structures</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>

DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree-like structure of the page that programmers use. HTML tags become elements and elements form a tree. Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page. The tree-like structure shows the relationship between a parents and a child element. The tree-like structure is similar to that of a family tree. One mother can have many children and those children can have children. There can also be boxes inside boxes, inside boxes and so on. </p>

  <b>Boxes!</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
Every element is a box, even the images that are not rectangular shaped. Boxes are defined with div tags. </p>

  <b>CSS</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. The 'C' in CSS is the most important aspect. It is a code written to control the “style” of HTML elements. CSS attributes and values website: https://developer.moxilla.org/en-US/docs/web/css </p></div></div>

<div class="section-details"><p>
Code comments are small notes for the developer. Browser will ignore the comments, hence the users will not see them. </p></div></div>

<div class="section-name">
  <b>Importance of Avoiding Repetition</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
Repeating the same code can lead to errors when developers want to make a change because the requirements have changed. Developer has to consistently make the same update to the code in all the instances of repeated code, otherwise errors will occur. 
  </p>
<p>
  By avoiding the repetition of code, you get the benefit of consistent behavior in your web page. In addition, avoiding repetition of code obviously saves time.

  <b>Box Model and Box Sizing </b>
</div>
      <div class="section-details">
  <p>

The box model includes contents, padding, borders and margins. HTML elements are box and each box has 4 components. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of the box right. There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues; set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels or set the box-sizing attributes to border-box for every element. </p>

  <b> Computers and Computer Programs
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details">
<p>
A computer is a universal machine that can be programmed to do anything, unlike a toaster for example which would need to be physically altered to perform a different task. The power of the computer is that it can execute steps really fast. We can execute billions of instructions in one second.
<p>A computer program is a sequence of steps that a computer can follow to do something useful. It gives us a way to tell the computer what steps to take. There are many different languages for programming computers. Ex: web browser, python interpreter, python code, calendar app on phone</p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b> Programming Language
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details">
<p>
A programming language is what programmers use to tell a computer what to do. Python is one example of a programming language.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b> Python
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details">
<p>
Python is a programming language. Instead of the program running directly on the computer, the programs we write will be an input to the python program which runs the computer. Python comments start with “#”. The python interpreter executes and understands the programs by running them into a language the computer can understand.
</p>
</div>
</div>




<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b> Language Ambiguity and Verbosity 
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details">
<p>
New languages were invented to program computers rather than using English, because of ambiguity. Different people can interpret the same sentence to mean many different things. We need to make sure the computer interprets the program the exact same way that we intended for it to be interpreted.
<p>Another reason is that natural languages like English are verbose. To write a program we need to describe exactly what the computer should do in a very precise sequence of steps. If we had to describe all those details using a natural language, it would require a huge amount of text. With python, we would only need a few lines of code to describe something complicated and describe it in a precise, step by step way.

<div class="section-details">
<p>
The purpose of the Backus-Naur form is to be able to precisely describe exactly the language in a way that’s very simple and concise.  Basically, it is the replacing of non-terminals with their replacements until we’re left with only terminals.

</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b> Grammar
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details">
<p>
Programming languages have grammar, just like natural languages. A grammar is a specification of what is "correct" and what is "incorrect”, in English. But, computers aren't smart enough to do this. This means we have to write code that is exactly "correct" according to the Python interpreter, otherwise our code won't run. Replacement grammar is when you are able to describe an infinitely large language with a small set of rules.

  <b> Python Expressions
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details">
<p>
A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: print 1 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 1 + (without a number at the end) is not.

<h2> Lesson 2: Variables and Strings 
</h2>
<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b>What is a variable?</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
A variable gives names to keep track of values. We can use the variable to create a name and use the name to refer to a variable. The way to introduce a variable is using an assignment statement.
<p>Assignment statement: name (the value the expression has) = expression 
<b>Ex: speed_of_light =299792458</b></p>
Variables can vary. Once we define a variable, we can change the value. And then when we use that name again it refers to the new value. You can re-assign at any time. 
<b>Ex: Original: days=7*7   ->49
Re-assigned: days=48</b>
The variable days is now changed from 49 to 48.
</p></div></div>

<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b>Strings</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. 
<b>Ex: ‘I am a string.’, “I prefer double quotes!”</b>
</p></div></div>

     <br>‘Udacity’[1+1] ->’a’</b>
</p></div></div>


<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b> Selecting Sub-sequences</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
A string that is a sub-sequence of characters in the input string (s), starting from the position start and ending with the position stop -1.
<string> [<expression>:<expression>]
<b>Ex: word= ‘assume’
<br>word [3:4] -> u
<br>word [4:6] -> me
<br>word [4:] ->me
<br>word[:] -> assume</b>
</p></div></div>

<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b> Finding Strings in Strings
</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>

The number that gives the first position in the search string is where the target string appears. If the target string is not found, it is -1.
<string>.find (<string>)
<b>Ex: pythagoras =There is geometry in the humming of strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.
<br>print pythagoras.find(‘string’)-> 40
<br>print pythagoras.find(‘T’) ->0
<br>print pythagoras.find[86:]->spheres</b>

<div class="section-name">
  <b>Parameter</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
A parameter will help you find other occurrences, not just the first one.
The number that gives the first position in the search string is where the target string appears (at or after the <number>).
<b>Ex: danaton=”De l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace.”
<br>print danaton.find(‘audace’) ->5 
<br>print danaton.find(‘audace’, 0) -> 5
<br>print danaton.find(‘audace’, 6) ->25</b>

        <b> What is a Function?
</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> 
A function takes an input, does something with it, and then produces an output. Functions are convenient because they can help you divide your code into apporpriate blocks, by condensing complicated problems into simpler ones. Some other advantages are that you can avoid repetition of code, as well as reusing code. <p> In other words, functions are little self-contained programs that perform a specific task. After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task.

        <b> How to Use a Function
</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      A function is made by using the def command and then given a name followed by the function parameters in opening and closing parentheses with any input value. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used.

        <b> Making Decisions with Code
</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> 
The operators for making decisions in Python give a boolean (true or false) result. 
<br><b>Ex: < number >< operator >< number >  
 <br>print 2<3</b> 
<br>The operators used are greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==) and not equal to (!=). The double equals sign is used because the single equal symbol is already used for assignment variables.

      To use the IF function, type<b> if < expression >: </b>then under that indent and type<b> <block></b> which will define what code is run if the expressions is true. If the expression is false it will skip this code. 
<p>You can also define an ELSE statement using the IF function; meaning if the IF function runs a result which is false it will then go to the ELSE statement and run that.</p>

<div class="section">
      <div class="section-name">
        <b> Loops
</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
A loop is a way of repeating a certain action. 
The WHILE loop starts with an expression that will validate the running of the loop followed by a colon. This is called a test expression. Inside of that we have the block that will run as long as the test expression is true. The difference between this and the IF command is that once it runs the command it will go back to check if the test expression is still true. If it is, it will run the block of code again, and it will keep doing that until the test expression shows a false value.
<br><b>Ex:
<br>i = 0
<br>while i < 10:
    <br>print i
        <br>i = i + 1</b>
<br>This will result in the code printing from 0 to 9. Once it gets to 10 it is no longer less than 10 so the code will not work.
An Infinite Loop is one that never finds a false value so will keep running.

        <b> Break statement
</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      A break gives you a way to stop the loop even if the condition is still true.
You could stick this in an IF command in the WHILE loop which will check to see if there is a reason to break the process or let it continue. If this IF statement is true and you break out of the loop you will then continue the code after the while loop. If it the IF statement is false it will continue to run the code and the loop and will check the IF statement again next time around.

      Classes and Object Oriented Programming (OOP), are techniques used by software engineers on a daily basis. They can use these techniques to write and share code amongst eachother. OOP is a valuable tool for large programing projects because it provides a modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden.
OOP also makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code, as well as providing a good framework for code libraries.

  One of the important characteristics of procedural programming is that it relies on procedures that operate on data  which are two separate concepts. In object-oriented programming, these two concepts are bundled into objects. This makes it possible to create more complicated behavior with less code.  Once you have created an object with more complex behavior, you can use it anywhere in your code.

Objects are the basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system. Programming problem is analyzed in terms of objects and nature of communication between them. When a program is executed, objects interact with each other by sending messages. Different objects can also interact with each other without knowing the details of their data or code.

Inheritance is the process by which objects can acquire the properties of objects of other class. In OOP, inheritance provides reusability, like, adding additional features to an existing class without modifying it. This is achieved by deriving a new class from the existing one. The new class will have combined features of both the classes.
